Scenario: You are a developer tasked with provisioning a basic web server
 infrastructure on AWS using Terraform. This infrastructure will consist
 of a single EC2 instance with a web server application pre-installed.

Steps:
Install Terraform:
Set Up Your AWS Credentials:
Create a Terraform Project To Create a t2.micro​ EC2 instance :
Note : Ensure the AMI you are using and region match

Take a working screenshot of the main.tf​ file for the above and the
resulting ec2 instance​ in the management console

Modify your Terraform script to include a security group​ that allows
inbound HTTP​ traffic and take screenshots of the modification process
 and security group rules

Make your final modification of the script to install a web server
i.e. apache2/nginx [note: they run on the same port] and show a working
server page
Create an output file that captures the following and capture the
resulting output
1.instance_id​
2.private_ip​
3.instance_name
